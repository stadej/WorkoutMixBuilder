Workout Mix Builder is a project built in React using the Spotify Web API

I love listening to music while I exercise, so I wanted to create this app to easily create customized playlists within a specified speed range.

To generate a playlist, you can provide up to five genres, artists, or songs, to provide recommendations, as well a range of bpm (beats per minutes) and a number of songs.
